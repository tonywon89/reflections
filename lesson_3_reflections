Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might pull it when you don't want to yet, or if you're in the middle of working on something 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks is when you want to make a copy of someone else's project. Clone to get it from github into local repository

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can work on it before making it public, so other people won't see it 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

I would have to save the document, and compare each other. Git and Github would be a lot easier to share files.
